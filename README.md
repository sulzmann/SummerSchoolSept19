# SummerSchoolSept19

We make use of the Go programming language various aspects of programming language design and analysis.
Rough overview of Go.


[http://golang.org/](Go)

* Go the better C?
* Statically typed/Simple form of type inference
* Higher-order functions (lambda calculus)
* Method overloading + Interfaces 
* Concurrency 
    * Light-weight threads
    * Channel-based communication
        * Formal foundations: Communicating Sequential Processes, Sir Tony Hoare
    * Philosophy: “Do not communicate by sharing memory. Instead
            share by communicating.”
            
The lecture notes are divided into three parts.

Part 1: Go basics + higher-order functions + lambda calculus

Part 2: Types, methods and overloading

Part 3: Concurrency

There are two extended examples (parser combinators + regular expression derivatives).

The lecture notes + examples are provided as html documents. Download the html files and view them via your browser of choice.
